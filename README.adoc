= Antora Navigation Orphans Checker

This project contains a Python and a Go implementation of a program used to check whether the `nav.adoc` file of an Antora documentation set contains orphans, that is, files that exist in the `modules/ROOT/pages` folder but who aren't referenced on the `nav.adoc` file.
