= Antora Navigation Orphans Checker

This project contains a Python and a Go implementation of a program used to check whether the `nav.adoc` file of an Antora documentation set contains orphans.

"Orphans" in this context, are files that exist in the `modules/ROOT/pages` folder but who aren't referenced on the `nav.adoc` file.

== Usage

Use the tool as follows:

[source,bash]
--
go build
antora-nav-orphans-checker /path/to/antora/documentation/docs
--

The tool exits with code 1 if some files are missing. The list of files is printed in the console. If no files are missing, the tool exists with code 0.

== Container

This project generates a container that can be used as follows:

[source,bash]
--
podman run --rm --volume "${PWD}":/antora ghcr.io/vshn/antora-nav-orphans-checker:main /antora/docs
--

== Unit Tests

Run the suite of unit tests:

[source,bash]
--
go test
--
